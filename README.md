# NIST-CSF-Incident-Report-Analysis
Created an incident report using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## Overview
This project was part of a Coursera activity in which I created an incident report using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).  
The scenario involved a multimedia company that experienced a DDoS attack caused by a flood of ICMP packets entering the network through an unconfigured firewall. The attack disrupted internal network services for two hours.

## Activity Summary
Using the NIST CSF, the task was to analyze the incident and document:
- **Identify:** Type of attack and affected systems  
- **Protect:** Safeguards needed to secure assets  
- **Detect:** Methods to monitor and identify similar threats  
- **Respond:** Steps to contain and mitigate future incidents  
- **Recover:** Actions to restore services and strengthen recovery processes

## Outcome
The analysis focused on improving firewall configurations, adding ICMP rate limiting, enabling IP spoofing checks, implementing IDS/IPS, and enhancing network monitoring to prevent similar DDoS attacks.
